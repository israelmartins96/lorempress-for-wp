Quickly add lorem ipsum dummy text as a placeholder text while creating your WordPress website, web page, blog post, etc.

== Description ==

LoremPress is a simple and easy-to-use WordPress plugin designed to help you quickly insert lorem ipsum dummy text as a placeholder in your posts and pages. Whether you're mocking up a new page, testing layouts, or just need placeholder content, LoremPress provides a convenient solution directly within your WordPress editor.

= Key Features: =

* **Easy Shortcode Integration:** Simply insert `[lorempress]` into any post or page content.
* **Lightweight and Efficient:** Designed to be minimal and not impact your site's performance.
* **No Configuration Needed:** Works out of the box without any settings to adjust.

Perfect for when you need realistic-looking placeholder paragraphs without the distraction of meaningful content, ensuring your designs and layouts are the focus.

== Installation ==

1. **Upload:** Upload the `lorempress-for-wp` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. **Activate:** Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. **Use:** Insert the `[lorempress]` shortcode on a new line in any post or page where you want to generate a lorem ipsum paragraph.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the plugin? =
Simply insert the `[lorempress]` shortcode on a new line in the content editor of any post or page. On the front-end view of the post or page, the shortcode is replaced with a randomly generated lorem ipsum paragraph.

= Can I customise the number of sentences in a paragraph? =
Currently, LoremPress generates a default amount of text. Future versions may include options for customising the length of the generated text content. If you would like to submit a feature request for that or something else, [you may do so here](https://lightbulbdevs.com/lorempress/wp/feature-request/).

= Is the lorem ipsum text truly random? =
Yes, the text of each paragraph is made up of randomly generated lorem ipsum sentences which mimic the appearance of real text without carrying any actual meaning.

= Will the plugin affect my site's performance? =
No, LoremPress is designed to be very lightweight and optimised for performance. It is only loaded and executed when the LoremPress shortcode is present on a page, and its impact on performance is negligible.
